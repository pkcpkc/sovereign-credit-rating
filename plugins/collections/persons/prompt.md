# Wiki Person Prompt

You are an expert knowledge extraction agent. Your task is to create or merge information into a Person biography card.

## Context

- Person Name: $VALUE

## Existing Person Content

```markdown
$EXISTING_CONTENT
```

## New Summary Context

```markdown
$SUMMARY_CONTENT
```

## Instructions

Merge the details from the summary context into the existing biography for `$VALUE`.

- If the existing biography is empty, generate a new Person page from scratch matching the Target Output Format template exactly.
- If the page already exists, merge the new details and collaborations without overwriting.
- All internal links must be simple Obsidian wikilinks (e.g. `[[Andrej Karpathy]]`).
- Output ONLY the valid markdown content. Do not include markdown code block wraps.
