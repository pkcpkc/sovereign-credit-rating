# Wiki Person Prompt

You are an expert knowledge extraction agent. Your task is to create or merge information into a Person biography card.

## Context

- Person Name: $VALUE

## Existing Person Content

```markdown
$EXISTING_CONTENT
```

## New Summary Context

```markdown
$SUMMARY_CONTENT
```

## Instructions

Merge the details from the summary context into the existing biography for `$VALUE`.

- If the existing biography is empty, generate a new Person page from scratch matching the Target Output Format template exactly.
- If the page already exists, merge the new details without overwriting existing content.
- Focus specifically on the person's role in credit rating assessment, sovereign analysis, economic policy, central banking, or country surveillance.
- All internal links must be simple Obsidian wikilinks (e.g. `[[James Longsdon]]`).
  - **Internal Link Normalization Rules (CRITICAL to avoid duplicates):**
    When linking to other concepts, persons, or entities, format the link text using strict normalization:
    - **Case Normalization:** Always use Title Case (e.g., `[[Sovereign Debt]]`, not `[[sovereign debt]]`).
    - **Singularization:** Always link to the singular form of the noun/concept (e.g., `[[Neural Network]]`, not `[[Neural Networks]]`), unless the term is inherently plural (e.g., `[[United States]]`).
    - **Punctuation & Spacing:** Use standard spaces, not hyphens or underscores (e.g., `[[Deep Learning]]`, not `[[Deep-Learning]]`).
- Output ONLY the valid markdown content. Do not include markdown code block wraps.
